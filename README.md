A robust network simulation project developed for the **Computer Networks** course. This project simulates a mission on a planet involving autonomous **Rovers**, a **Mothership (Gateway)**, and a **Ground Control** station on Earth.

The system implements a custom **Reliable UDP Protocol** (Application Layer) capable of handling high packet loss, duplication, and data fragmentation, featuring a real-time Web Dashboard.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📡 Custom Reliability Protocol (App Layer)
We implemented a **Stop-and-Wait ARQ** mechanism over UDP to simulate challenging space links:
* **ACK System:** Every critical message (Status, Progress, Photos) requires an acknowledgment.
* **Automatic Retransmission:** Retries sending packets up to 5 times before entering a "persistence mode".
* **Duplicate Detection:** Filters out duplicated packets caused by network echoes using Sequence Numbers.
* **Connection Handshake:** Rovers initiate a connection (`STATUS: DESCONECTADO`) and wait for the Mothership's approval before starting operations.

### 📸 Data Fragmentation
* Simulates sending **High-Res Photos** from Mars.
* Splits large binary data into smaller **chunks (Fragments)** (Max 250 bytes).
* Reassembles them at the destination using `MORE_FRAGS` flags and offsets.

### 🎮 Ground Control Dashboard
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Python (Backend) + HTML/JS (Frontend).
* **Real-time Telemetry:** Updates Battery, Position (X,Y), and Status (`IDLE`, `EM_MISSAO`, `CHARGING`).
* **Mission Control:** Send commands (Collect Minerals, Photos, Seismic Analysis) directly from the browser.
* **Visual Status:** Rovers appear "Greyed out" until the handshake is complete.

### 📝 Auto-Logging
* Automatically generates timestamped logs (e.g., `navemae_2025-12-10_15-30.log`) for all nodes in the `logs/` folder.
* Records every ACK, Timeout, and Retransmission for post-mission analysis.

## 🛠️ Network Topology

The simulation runs inside the **CORE Network Emulator** with the following nodes:

1.  **Ground Control (Earth):** Runs the Firefox Dashboard.
2.  **Nave-Mãe (Mothership):** Acts as the central gateway/server.
3.  **Rovers (Alpha, Beta, Gamma):** Autonomous clients gathering data.
4.  **Satellite/Switch:** Simulates the link with **25% Packet Loss** and **20% Duplication** to test protocol robustness.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
* Linux Environment (Virtual Machine).
* **CORE Network Emulator** installed.
* Python 3.

### Steps

1.  **Open CORE:**
    Open the topology file (`.imn`) in the CORE GUI.

2.  **Start Emulation:**
    Click the **Green Play Button** ▶️ in CORE to start the network.

3.  **Launch the System:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run the automation script:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Desktop/TP2
    chmod +x run_core.sh
    ./run_core.sh
    ```

    > **What this script does:** It automatically detects the active CORE session, launches the Python scripts inside the specific virtual nodes, creates log files in `logs/`, and opens the Firefox dashboard.

4.  **Stop Simulation:**
    Press `CTRL + C` in the terminal to kill all processes safely.

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

You can verify the system's robustness by applying "Link Effects" in CORE:

* **Scenario A (Perfect Network):** 0% Loss. Immediate ACKs.
* **Scenario B (Mars Storm):** **25% Loss**. Watch the logs show `[TIMEOUT] Retransmitting (1/5)...`. The system will recover automatically.
* **Scenario C (Echoes):** **20% Duplication**. Watch the logs show `[DUPLICADO] Packet ignored`.
